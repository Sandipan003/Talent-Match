## Troubleshooting

### Common issues:

1. **NLTK Data Download Issues**: If NLTK data download fails, manually download the required packages:
   ```python
   import nltk
   import ssl
   try:
       _create_unverified_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context
   except AttributeError:
       pass
   else:
       ssl._create_default_https_context = _create_unverified_https_context
   nltk.download('punkt')
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   nltk.download('wordnet')
   ```

2. **scikit-learn Installation Issues on Windows**: Install the Microsoft C++ Build Tools:
   - Download from: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
   - Or use a pre-built wheel: `pip install --only-binary=:all: scikit-learn`

3. **Database Issues**: If you encounter database errors, delete the existing database file and reinitialize:
   ```
   rm instance/resume_screening.db
   python seed.py
   ```
